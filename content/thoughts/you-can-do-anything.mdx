you dont need anyones permission, you have free will <br/>
no, literally <br/>
you can just wake up one day and decide: <br/>
*“I'm done, this is it, I want change, i want to be better, I want to grow”* <br/>
you can decide to stop reading this post, you can continue to the end <br/>
you can just build what you want to build<br/>
message anyone<br/>
call anyone<br/>
you can just do things<br/>
you can take a flight and relocate to another city<br/>
don't overthink, just do. <br/>
you'll figure it out along the way. all you have to do is start.<br/>
people hesistate because they're crippled by the fear of failure, failure is okay<br/>
just do it<br/>
